# ModBot for Squabblr
@modbot for squabblr.co

In development moderation bot that started as a fork of [squabbles-summarybot](https://github.com/thatjpcsguy/squabbles-summarybot).

## Roadmap
- Autoresponder to posts within a community (maybe based on [reddit-comment-bot](https://github.com/yashar1/reddit-comment-bot))
- Auto lock threads based on some kind of circumstance that will be determined later.
- Integration with Discord to notify you of things(?) or manage.
- `!remindme` handling (maybe based on [remindmebot-reddit](https://github.com/SIlver--/remindmebot-reddit))
- Notify mod based on keyword scans within their community posts/comments. (maybe based on [ReplyBot](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/tree/master/_old/ReplyBot) or [Alert-Bot-Reddit](https://github.com/tylerbrockett/Alert-Bot-Reddit))
- Notify mod via email (maybe based on [MailMe](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/tree/master/_old/MailMe))
- Somehow set up a way for this to be all set up by a mod via DM to @modbot?
- If we ever get a "held for moderation" type system in Squabblr, auto-hold all new posts. Could possibly include a whitelist. (maybe based on [SourceIt](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/tree/master/_old/SourceIt))
- Auto welcome post to new posts (and subscribers?) to the community. (maybe based on [WelcomeBot](https://github.com/voussoir/reddit/tree/master/_old/WelcomeBot))
